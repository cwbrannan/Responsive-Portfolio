            <p>Hey there! I'm Chris Brannan. I've lived in Arizona for the past 17 years, however I was born and raised in California. I graduated from ASU with a bachelors degree in Economics and I'm one of those weird people that actually enjoys it. I love staying active and when I'm not hanging out with my 9 month old pup you can catch me wakeboarding and surfing during the summer and snowboarding during the winter.</p>
            <p>I currently work for State Farm as a personal lines underwriter. Overall its been a rewarding experience however I'm currently looking to change careers and pursue a long time interest in web development and coding. I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp through the University of Arizona in hopes to make that interest into a long and rewarding career.</p>
